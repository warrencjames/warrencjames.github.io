    "# Project Goals\n",
    "* Analyze BMI within each region\n",
    "* Garner insight about how different factors influence the cost of insurance by averaging data.\n",
    "* Use comparative analysis to compare the three most expensive patients and the three cheapest patients\n",
    "\n",
    "## BMI By Region\n",
    "* The four regions represented in the data set are Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, and Southeast\n",
    "* Find the total number of patients for each region. Then find the number of underweight, healthy, overweight, and obese patients within each region. The BMI ranges for each category can be found in the note below.\n",
    "* Finally, break down each region and represent each bmi range as a percent of the total population within each region.\n",
    "    * i.e. Northwest: x% underweight, y% healthy, z% overweight, w% obese; Southwest: (etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Averaging Analysis\n",
    "* Compare average cost of smokers to average cost of non-smokers\n",
    "* Compare average cost of males to average cost of females\n",
    "* Compare average cost of patients in age ranges of teens, 20s, 30s, etc.\n",
    "* Compare average cost of patients with different numbers of children (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "* Compare average cost of patients in the different BMI ranges (see note below)\n",
    "* Compare average insurance cost by region (SW, SE, NW, NE)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparative Analysis\n",
    "* Examine the patients with the three highest and three lowest insurance costs and analyze the factors involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CDC, a BMI of less than 18.5 is in the underweight range. A BMI between 18.5 and < 25 is a healthy range, 25 to < 30 is overweight and 30 or higher is obese. These are the ranges for which I will compare average insurance costs and analyze BMI by region. \n",

    "## Averaging Analysis\n",
    "### Patients that smoke pay 23615.96 more on average than patients that don't smoke.\n",
    "This is by far the highest discrepancy in average insurance cost out of all of the factors in the data set. If a patient wanted to lower their insurance cost, the first thing they should do is stop smoking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Men pay 1387.17 more than women, on average.\n",
    "This is the lowest discrepancy in average insurance cost. It's entirely possible that men and women are not charged differently for insurance and this is only due to variance in the other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is clear that the average cost of insurance increases as age increases.\n",
    "The difference between the oldest range's average and the youngest range's average is 12840.67. \n",
    "The biggest jump occurs between the 50-60 range and the 60-70 range, at about 5000. It appears the curve steepens as the patient gets older.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data is unclear about any influence that number of children has on insurance costs.\n",
    "The first four demographics (No children, one child, two children, and three children) suggest an increasing trend, however the fifth demographic (four children) is lower than that of two or three children, and the sixth demographic (five children) is lower than all other demographics by a significant margin (about 4000 lower than the second lowest). One possible reason for this is that there is a significantly smaller sample size in the fifth and sixth demographics. This could lead to lower accuracy in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would tentatively suggest that having more children results in higher insurance costs, but not with considerable confidence, at least from an average-analysis standpoint. Another form of analysis would likely provide better insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The difference between the obese range average and underweight range average is 6894.71. The data suggests that average cost of insurance increases as BMI increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one metric that patients have at least some agency over (as opposed to something like age). Analysis has revealed that a vast majority of the sample population is in the obese range, and many of these patients are paying higher premiums than those in healthier categories. Patients in the obese category should consider working toward lowering their bmi if they want to lower their insurance costs. While those in the underweight category are paying less for insurance, it is not advisable to drop below a BMI in the 'healthy' range. "
